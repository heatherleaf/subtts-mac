SubTTS for Mac
==============

SubTTS reads a movie subtitles file, and uses the built-in speech synthesiser 
to read the subtitles aloud while you are watching the movie. 

The program is a standalone "Menulet", a program that sits in the menu bar 
and talks to your favourite video player. 
Currently it supports Quicktime Player X, Quicktime Player 7, VLC Player, and DVD Player.
It should work for Mac OSX 10.6 and above.

Usage
-----

	git clone ... (or use GitHub.app)
	cd subtts-mac
	git submodule update --init --recursive
	open SubTTS.xcodeproj

Hit `Command-R` to build and run the project in Xcode. You need the free Xcode from the Mac App store.

SubTTS is open-source and released under GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or above.

More information
----------------

The program was developed during the research project "Pratmakaren", 
hosted by [DART](http://www.dart-gbg.org/english) at Sahlgrenska University Hospital,
and [CLT](http://clt.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg.
The project was financed by the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority.

The underlying idea is described in the following publication:
